Course Description
Introduction:  Economic globalization can provide enormous strategic benefits (risks) by coordinating operations located in different countries. Operations in this course include from new product introduction, design, logistics, through warranty support, and through sustainable closed loop practices. Today’s producers must coordinate international material flow, produce in multiple countries, and deliver new products to customers at ever increasing speed and on-time.  Many global operations seem to fall short of their strategic expectations.  This course will provide students with an opportunity to explore the reasons many managers see enormous promise in globalized operations, particularly those in developing nations like China and Vietnam, as well as the obstacles they face that can make achieving that strategy so difficult.

Objectives:  Helping students understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for attaining world class performance and relationships with Shanghai and Saigon-based enterprises, is the main learning objective of this course package.  The classes will have a special emphasis on multinational companies producing in the greater Siagon and Shanghai areas. The course is to be approached 

Course Content:  The course will cover five major topics & ~10 tours / Guest lectures associated:  


1.	Sourcing Strategies & supplier qualification 

2.	Logistics, 3D printing, Relationships 

3.	New Product Introduction (NPI) and Sourcing Strategies 

4.	Outsourcing and Off-shoring locations 

5.	Cultural experience – Mekong Delta & The Great Wall


Methodology:  Through a combination of readings, case studies, tours, and lectures, the course will introduce analytic approaches, highlight key leadership issues, and review current trends.  The lectures will introduce the client to be toured and concepts and techniques that can be used to analyze and improve global supply chains.  The expectations paper is assigned to help students think about preconceived thoughts on China or Vietnam and then reflect upon those when writing their daily abstracts paper. The case will focus on the challenges of doing business without representation within a particular country.


Course Requirements

-As you will note in the course schedule, certain readings and cases will be assigned for particular visits and class meetings.  It is important that you carefully read the assignments and analyze the each case/s prior to coming on the trip.  You will be assigned into groups prior to our trip and it will be posted to d2L; I encourage you to actively discuss all readings, case, and tours in your teams. To help you systematically analyze the case & articles, I will provide a list of questions for each.

-This course is designed for each student & group to analyze supplier visits for strengths and weaknesses. Each trip will be discussed in class that afternoon or next day pending schedules. The class time will be in 3 parts:
- Review content materials to prepare for the daily trip
- Use scorecard analysis and strategy to review each supplier / location
- Discuss in detail during class thoughts on the level of maturity and capability of each supplier.
- The outcome is the 1 page abstract that summarizes each review of the location visited. These are to be done individually.


Requirements:  In addition to the daily field trips, the course has the following requirements: 

Prior to the Trip: Read as much of the material as you have time to complete. This will make your visit much more enjoyable as you will have more free time.


1.a) After the pre-departure mtg and reading the pre-trip assignments, write a 3 page summary (double spaced, 12pt font, APA format or another approved in advance) regarding your expectations in China & Vietnam Factories / Supply Chains and how outsourcing or off-shoring might interact with CSR from your sustainable operations course. Include your cultural expectations as well as business strategy deployment. This (a)is due August 8th by 12:00 noon. 

1. b) Final reflection abstract(not to exceed 2 pages) Describe your individual experience from your perspective.  This should go beyond a factual description, and should allow the reader to see the experience through your eyes and understand the effect of the experience on you.  This (b) is due with your Final paper. Please be sure to address the questions below:
1.	What behaviors or values did you encounter that were different than your own?  Why are they different?  To what do you attribute the differences?
2.	As a consequence of your experience, are there things you would like to learn more about?
3.	If given the opportunity, would you be willing to seek or undertake similar experiences?  Why or why not?
4. As you reflect on this experience, are there things you would do differently?  Why
1 a & b – 25%

2. Daily critical thinking / presentation of tour analysis & class participation, In teams you will consider course content and apply these to the factories we visit. Each team will play the role of supplier sourcing manager who is auditing the supplier’s processes. Following a visit you will work in groups and then present what you found using the hp TQRDCEB or the book methodology. - 50% 

3. Final abstract paper (not to exceed 10 - 13 pages, double spaced, 12pt font, APA format or another approved in advance. All assertions must be supported by citations. The paper is due by 5 PM September 10th ); Write about each of the tours and reflect upon what your team recommended, did the operations execute the strategies we discussed, was it in a CSR perspective? We will allow time to write the abstracts while we are in the cities we tour, this should mean the bulk of the paper is completed while in Vietnam & China. Reflect on whether the outcome matched your culture and strategic expectations discussion at the beginning of course. Include references from a minimum of 2 outside readings and lectures that support your assertions in the body of the paper. – 25%



Here is a suggested outline for your final paper:
•	Introduction – 1 page total
•	Description and analysis of the company’s supply chain operations in China & Saigon – 1 page each (write these daily in class while on the trip)
o	Operations strategy and areas of operational interest
o	Firm’s current challenges from your analysis above
•	OR
o	A more detailed writing of 1-2 trips and how that made an impact on your knowledge in supply chain management.
•	Comparison of culture of business conduct and expectations 1 page
•	Optional: Mekong Delta importance to SE Asia and culture or the rivers in China & their importance to the Chinese infrastructure 1 page
•	Conclusion including reflections 1 page
•	References cited 1- page


Your grade will be determined according to the writing rubric posted in d2L.

Please make sure to address the following questions:
Are assumptions made in the analysis stated explicitly?
Does the paper reflect an important and serious research effort?
Does the analysis show a good command of the concepts reviewed in the readings and class discussion?
Does the writing flow logically consistent and effectively structured?
Does the content include both supply chain methodologies as well as cultural discoveries regarding Saigon & Shanghai suppliers and markets?
Are data points cited for accuracy?

Class Participation
I encourage you to actively participate in the classroom sessions.  Each discussion regarding the cases, articles, & tours will begin with “what do we know about this company?” All discussions should build upon each of the student teams offering a unique critique of the case. For example,

•	If you are not clear about a concept being discussed in the class, please ask questions.  I consider asking relevant questions as a very important form of class participation. Do not be shy if sourcing is a new concept to you, please ask!
•	If you have an interesting experience or insight that either supports or contradicts the concept being discussed, please share it with the class.
•	If you learned something on the field trip that supported or contradicted what we learned in class, either SCM or culturally related.
•	Do not repeat the same analysis that another team has already shared, try to bring a unique perspective and consider that no nuance is trivial in business.
•	If you have a tough question for a supplier, you can wait until class time to bring this up. I have been to most of these so I should be able to provide insight.



Course Materials:

Journal Articles: An important part of the course will be discussion regarding current trends in global sourcing and operations. The articles are intended to help you prepare for each day’s topic and additive to your assertions when writing your research paper. These will be available through the PSU on-line library, or HBC website for purchase.

White paper: The hp way, read the TQRDCEB white paper prior to the trip.
